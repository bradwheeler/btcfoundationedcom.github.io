# Education Committee Meeting Minutes - July 15, 2014

## Attendees

- Bradford Wheeler
- John Meese
- Nikos Bentenitis

## Updates and Action Items

1. Nikos Bentenitis shared with the committee that both Jinyoung Englund and Jon Matonis has reached out to him. Unfortunately, Nikos did not have the chance to talk with neither Jon nor Jinyoung yet. Everybody thought that was a positive development and hoped that the publication of the blog post will take place soon. 

2. Charles Hoskinson, the first chair of the education committee, who's worked with Invictus Innovations and Ethereum has asked Nikos to include the work of the committee in the appendix of his Udemy.com course [Bitcoin: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Crypto](https://www.udemy.com/bitcoin-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-crypto/). Nikos told Charles that he can use the committee's work as he sees fit, a policy that was discussed before Charles reached out to Nikos (see [minutes from June 17, 2014](https://github.com/btcfoundationedcom/btcfoundationedcom.github.io/blob/master/minutes/2014-06-17.md), item 2). John Meese thought that the committee could adopt a Creative Commons License so that the policy is clear on the Committee's Github page. John will share his suggestion for a license with the committee via email.

3. John Meese shared that he has been working on [bitcoin101hq.com](http://bitcoin101hq.com), a project designed to focus on introductory content for anyone new to the Bitcoin world. Anyone can submit a Bitcoin-related question via [bitcoin101hq.com/ask](http://bitcoin101hq.com/ask/) and answers are community-based and can be voted on. If anyone would like to submit a guest post to this project, or help in moderating questions and answers, they can contact John at [chief@bitcoin101hq.com](mailto:chief@bitcoin101hq.com).

4. The next meeting of the education committee will take place at 10 pm Eastern Time (4 am Central European Time), on July 22.
